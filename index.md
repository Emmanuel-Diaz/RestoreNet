## Introduction
**Intro** here


It is widely known that old photos converted from film to digital might have experienced some degradation in the process. World War II photos are no exception and properly restoring these images will benefit us in preserving historical documents. We will investigate if using GANs to approach the ‘image inpainting’ problem, where sections of the image are occluded and we have to ‘fill in the blanks’, will give us not only a perceptual improvement in quality but also a quantification of how well the restoration occurred.

## Data Collected
In order to understand the data population, I saved 3K images from [ww2db.com](https://ww2db.com/) and categorized them into 3 sections: Pre-War, Mid-War, Late-War

## Results
For the first test, we try **block inpainting** where a center block is inpainted and the
